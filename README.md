## Project Overview 📚

Our face recognition attendance system is designed to recognize and record the attendance of individuals in real-time. The system uses OpenCV for detecting and recognizing faces, and Tkinter for creating an easy-to-use graphical user interface.

## Features 🌟

- **Real-time Face Detection:** Uses OpenCV to detect faces in real-time. 📸
- **Face Recognition:** Identifies and verifies faces against a pre-trained dataset. 🧠
- **Attendance Logging:** Automatically logs the attendance of recognized individuals. 📝
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface built with Tkinter. 💻

## Installation 🛠️

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/RaionChan/Face_Recognition/
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Face_Recognition
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 🚀

1. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Interact with the GUI:**
   - **Start the Camera:** Click on the "Start Camera" button to begin the face detection process. 🎥
   - **Mark Attendance:** Recognized faces will be automatically logged for attendance. 📅

## Dependencies 📦

- **Python 3.7+** 🐍
- **OpenCV (cv2)** 👁️
- **Tkinter** 🖼️

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Face Detection:** The system uses OpenCV's pre-trained models to detect faces from the video feed. 👀
2. **Face Recognition:** Detected faces are compared against a database of known faces using feature matching techniques. 🔐
3. **Attendance Logging:** If a face is recognized, the attendance is logged with the current date and time. 🕒
